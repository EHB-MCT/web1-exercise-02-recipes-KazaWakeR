    <h3>instruction</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1:Preheat the skillet – Adding garlic to a cold pan increases the potential for sticking. Be sure the skillet is heated to medium, then add the garlic, herbs, and chili flakes.</li>
        <li>2:Have your tomatoes red to pour before you begin cooking. You only need 30 seconds to saute the garlic. If you pause to locate and open your tomato cans, you can easily scorch the garlic.</li>
        <li>3:Start the pasta before you start the sauce. If you start with dry pasta, you need about 20 minutes to bring the water to a boil, cook the pasta, and drain it. You’ll need less time than that to cook the sauce.</li>
        <li>4:Use a skillet or pot with a lid to avoid tomato splatter. I can’t tell you how many times it's happened – I grab my big skillet, I can't find the correct lid, and then I end up scraping tomato splatter off the walls.</li>
        <li>5:Pre-measure and pack the dried herbs and chili flakes, grab the canned tomatoes, a small bottle of Balsamic, and dry pasta, and you have a quick, satisfying, camping meal.</li>
        <li>6:Although this sauce is super quick, you can make it ahead and keep it in the fridge for a week or in the freezer for later use. Add this to leftover rice or even mashed potatoes when there isn’t a minute to spare between you and the dinner table.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
